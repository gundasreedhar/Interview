/*
Inner class is a class within a class.

Types of Inner classes:-
1. Nested or non-static inner class
2. Static Nested class 
3. Method Local inner class  
4. Anonymous class
5. Lambda

*/
/* This is "Anonymous_inner_class" example
 * Anonymous inner class is a inner class with no name to it.
 * They make the code to look more concise.
 * They enable us to declare and instantiate a class at the same time.
 * They are like Local Class only but they dont have a name to it.
 * These are used when we NEED a class ONLY ONCE. AND if u need to override a method for a perticular object 
   only. i.e., 
  
 * Anonymous_inner_class allow us to OVERRIDE the method, ADD NEW method and data member to that object ONLY.
	And this DOES NOT AFFECT the original members of class upon other object creation. 

 * If interface is there then we are going to create the class and implement that interface ONLY for once.
   where as, if it is a concrete class or abstract class then we are going to override the required method 
   and can add new mthods or filds if req for that perticular object ONLY.

  --------------------------------------
   syntax:->
 
   Test t = new Test()
   {
	 //defining the body for t
   };
   ---------------------------------------
   Test can be concrete class, abstract class 
   or intrface
 * These two cases are demonstrated below:
 * 
 * we have three types Anonymous inner class they are:
   1. Anonymous inner class that extends a class.
   2. Anonymous inner class that implements a interface.
   3. Anonymous inner class that defines inside the method/ constructor argument.
        - in this we define the annms_class that implements a interface and creates the object of that class
			and the ref of that object is PASSED as argument of that menthod or constructor.
			 ex:
				-----------------------------------------------------
			    Thread t = new Thread ( new Runnable()
				{  // annoms_class that implements Runnable interface
					public void disp()
					{
						System.out.println("my name is shreedhar");
					}
				});

				t.disp();
				------------------------------------------------------
